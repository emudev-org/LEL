<h1>The Lesser Emudrama License Family<h1>

How about we share knowledge and collaborate but with less drama and bad actors?

See <a href="https://github.com/emudev-org/lel”>our github</a> for more information and to pitch ideas.

Also see <a href=”https://emudev.org”>emudev.org</a> for more information on emulation, emudev, etc.

Kind regards,

The LEL Committee
